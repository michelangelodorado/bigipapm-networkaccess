The BIG-IP Access Policy Manager network access feature provides secure access to corporate applications and data using a standard web browser, or the BIG-IP Edge Client. Using network access, employees, partners, and customers can have access to corporate resources securely, from any location. 

The network access feature provides users with the functionality of a traditional IPsec VPN client. Unlike IPsec, however, network access does not require any pre-installed software or configuration on the remote user's computer. It is also more robust than IPsec VPN against router and firewall incompatibilities.
